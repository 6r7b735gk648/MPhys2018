# MPhys2018

This Git holds the code base used to stabilise and test a reaction wheel inverted pendulum. 

Note, the code presented here is a combination of my own work and libraries. For the sake of academic integrity this distinction must be made.

The following are purely copies of libraries available elsewhere on GitHub: I2CScanner and I2CSniffer.

Communication between the IMU and arduino was achieved using code, modified and adapted by me, from the following repository: <a href="url">https://github.com/bolderflight/MPU9250</a>.
